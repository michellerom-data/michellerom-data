## 👋 Hi, I'm Michelle

I use data engineering to support mission-driven teams—especially in education, nonprofits, and tech for good. I love making messy systems manageable—building cloud-based pipelines, modernizing legacy workflows, and writing documentation that actually helps people.

With a background in nonprofit data analytics, I stay grounded in clarity, usability, and impact. I’ve worked end-to-end across the data lifecycle—from collection and transformation to analysis and communication. 

Today, I focus on maintaining and enhancing config-based data pipelines using Python, YAML, JSON, and AWS services like S3 and Redshift.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- Build and maintain cloud-native data pipelines  
- Improve system usability and documentation for long-term clarity  

### 🌟 Recent Project
Refactored a key part of our state processing pipeline, learning XML on the fly, improving script flexibility with config dictionaries, and documenting the whole workflow for maintainability.

### 💡 Values
I thrive on teams that value curiosity, learning, and building tools that make others’ jobs easier. My work is always driven by purpose—whether it's improving education systems, supporting multilingual learners, or building tech that serves real people.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect
Feel free to email me to chat about all things usability, data system design, documentation woes, and anything else that comes to mind!
